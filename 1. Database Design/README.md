## What is a Data Warehouse?
data warehouse is a collection of data. It has the following properties:

- Subject-oriented: A data warehouse should contain information about a few well-defined subjects rather than the enterprise.
- Integrated: A data warehouse is an integrated repository of data. It contains information from various systems within an organisation.
- Non-volatile: The data values in a database cannot be changed without a valid reason.
- Time-variant: A data warehouse contains historical data for analysis.
